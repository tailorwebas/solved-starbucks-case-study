Read the <a title="Starbucks case analysis" href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nithingeereddy/files/starbucks_case_analysis.pdf" rel="nofollow">Starbucks’ case study</a>. This case study uses Porter’s Value Chain and Five Forces models and a SWOT (strengths-weaknesses-opportunities) analysis to develop strategic recommendations. On page 7 of the Starbuck’s case study there are 10 recommendations. Choose 3 of the recommendations and identify how IT could be used as part of the implementation of that recommendation. Research in the library how other companies have done something similar for each of your 3 recommendations. Your paper should be at least 3 pages, not counting the title and reference pages. The paper must include at least 3 references from peer-reviewed articles in academic journals. Make sure you have in-text citations and a reference page.  You can include additional references from websites and books. The rubric for this assignment can be viewed when clicking on the assignment link.
